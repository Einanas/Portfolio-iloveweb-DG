## Sprint 14 Lose Your Head - The Client Case
**[BEFORE THE SPRINT REVIEW]**   
**How did you prepare for the sprint review?**  
- _I made an **Agenda** on what we want to discuss and present to the client along with my teammate Viresh to which we combined our opinions together (diverge-converge technique). Here is the link to the [Project Details](https://github.com/orgs/fdnd-agency/projects/81/views/1?pane=info&statusUpdateId=154796) to view the <ins>Sprint Review Agenda</ins>._  
- _We also made sure that our READ.me will be in order for the Sprint Review by giving each which will be done by Viresh and Mikiyas._

**[AFTER THE SPRINT REVIEW]**   
**Hoe heeft de sprint review voorbereiding geholpen? Wat zou je de volgende keer anders doen?**. 
- _De voorbereiding heeft geholpen om als richtlijn aan te houden bij het presenteren wat we als team hebben gemaakt._  
- _Wat wel beter kon was dat ik voormijzelf steekwoorden moest opschrijven omdat ik afdwaalde en erg struikelde over mijn woorden en voor mijn gevoel onzeker over kwam._

### Learning Questions - Retrospective
**Describe how the format helped your retrospective?**  
*It was a guiding principle in coming up with answers as sometimes you aren't sure on what specific area you want to give feedback.*

**Benoem de inzichten die je hebt en die je voortaan anders wilt aanpakken**
*If i have any questions, don't stay too long stuck on it and ask help on time.*


Wat heb je geleerd van je living standards?
*I have learned... See more in [be-a-bargain-not-a-scam.md](be-a-bargain-not-a-scam.md).*


## Sprint 15 Choices Choices

#### Assignment: The good, the bad & the ugly 

DO the [Retromat #121](https://retromat.org/en/?id=121) on your mentor skills
  1. **The good**:  
    *A good preparation would get me open to receive questions and help students. If random questions get asked, i would have atleast read about it and explain it in a summery.*
  2. **The bad**:  
    *The first day i was a mentor, i didn't prepare for the class (read the instructions) on what would be discussed in the lecture. So when students asked me for questions, i had a harder time answer them and felt like i made a fool of myself by having to research everytime in fear of giving misinformation.*
  3. **The ugly**:  
    *I find it difficult to keep asking questions to students to get them out of their bubble/comfort zone so they can ask me questions about the teaching material or subjects they are confused about. This keeps me awkwardly quiet.*  

**Write two areas of improvement that you will address in the coming two weeks:**
  1. *A good preparation of the lecture (reading the instructions) gives me a redline of chronology of explaining stuff to students.*
  2. *Ask more proactive questions to receive more questions from students and be more of help to them.*

### ✒️ Learning Questions - Mentor

- **How will reflecting on your mentoring role help you improve your skills?**
  - *You want to find solutions to help students understand the course material so they can produce good work.*
- **What makes a mentor a good mentor?**
  - *What makes a good mentor is how you can guide a student through their learning journey and personal development by offer them skills, knowledge and tools*
- **How do you see developers being trained in the future?**
  - *Not much but i think it would be to educate them how the system works (if we are talking about a course or company), offer them tools to broaden their knowledge and offer assistance where needed.*

### ✒️ Learning Questions - Refinement
**How did the refinement on the backlog go?**. 
- *It went really well. This way it wouldn't seem a huge of a task to work on, e.g., a user story. It gives peace of mind and a clear lookout on the work you have given it a Acceptance criteria, Prioritised (planning poker), divided (sub-issues) so you can have a overview of the work that is yet to come and can be picked up.*

**Hoe helpt een refinement jouw project?**
- *The refinement helps give a clear lookout on the work and a nice order of picking up tasks (issues) once you've finished your own work and can pick up the next task.*
