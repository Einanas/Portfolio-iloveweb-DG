# ✒️ Learning Questions about Frameworks

## 11ty Framework
- What steps do you take to try out a new framework?
  1. *First, you want to follow the steps of installment of the framework which you can follow step by step. The one i used is [11ty.rocks](https://11ty.rocks/posts/create-your-first-basic-11ty-website/#run-the-develop-server).*
  2. *Second (optional),* (if you have the time of course) *try out the advanced features of 11ty.*
  3. *Try and make a small project with some documentation, data, animation and etc. to give a feel if 11ty is a nice framework to work with or if something lacks or isn't clear.*

- For what type of project would you choose 11ty?
  1. *A project that mostly exists out of markdowns, for example could also be good for your portfolio where you can show what you build and have learned and explain it.*
  2. *Or for researches, for example if you do research on certain international frontend development and try it out, you could use it to document, show your findings, experiments and showcase it.*

- How did you ensure that you and your team know what steps you are taking today?
  1. *If we're talking about team assignment, we laid out what we have on the projectboard and what facts have change since the Sprint Review in Sprint 14 (which we also put in the projectboard). After that we divided work and promised each other to contact each other if we get stuck or don't get enough time to finish something.*
