## Questions to ask yourself:
* Who will design my portfolio?
* Do I still have an old portfolio?
* Who will view my portfolio?
* What do I want to show on my portfolio?
* How much time should I spend on my portfolio?
* What do I need a portfolio for?

> **Should a developer be able to design and should a designer be able to develop?**

## How to get started:
- An overview of your ideas, so choose images;
- How do you want to present yourself?
- Purpose;
- Notes;
- Concepts are created.

**Should every element on your site have some form of animation?**
- Incorporate your own creativity into your portfolio.
- Promote your tools and skillset to your client.

**Is your own portfolio the worst product you will ever deliver?**
- Update your portfolio every now and then and keep up with the trends, so the code conventions that are newly released.

> _Side note:_  
_Make `<canvas>` and webGL behave differently individually_

### Code tips/advice for your portfolio:
- Resets all styling that the browser itself adds.  
- Ease in functions ready on a list. This can be done in CSS and JavaScript.  
- Make Components.  
- Use Box-sizing.

**Do you work for yourself or for a company?**
Then be project-specific. Know when to show something to your clients and when not to.
