## Vasili’s van Gemert

[Mr. Vasili's website](https://vasilis.nl)

**His advice:**  
- Discover new things and go make experiments.
- Make weird stuff

### Introduction
Mr. van Gemert mainly works only with HTML and CSS.   
He studied art and has a passion for art, but unfortunately it costs a lot of money.  
So he continued with web design.  
He went wild, started experimenting and trying out new things and creating things that matched his knowledge of art.  
For example, he has made many clocks using only HTML and CSS.

### Accessibility
Too much content can be frustrating for disable people. 

Animated illustration for blind people, instead of showing an illustration and then showing the alternative texts (`alt`):  
_First the text that is funny (with an `alt` attribute) and then show the actual animation (for non disabled people)._
